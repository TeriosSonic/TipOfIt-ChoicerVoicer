# TO THE TIP OF IT (Choicer Voicer Pack)
Choicer Voicer pack with collective brainrot from multiple groups
**To download the voice pack**, go to the top of the website and hit *Code -> Download ZIP*. Then, extract it to your `packs_voice` folder in The Choicer Voicer's `game` folder.

## Other packs:
* none for now haha

## Guidelines (for contributions)
* **Categories:** If there are enough voice clips of a thing for it to warrant its own category, make it its own folder and have a thumbnail/name and other required files for it. Said files being:
  * **`_author.txt`:** credits, will link to this repo to be less cluttersome to work with
  * **`_subtitle.txt`:** short description of the category
  * **`_pack_filler_image.png`:** square thumbnail for the voice pack (will also act as placeholder image for clips that do not have one)
* **Uncategorized clips:** If a clip doesn't fit any existing categories it will go in the *Miscellaneous* folder.
* **Noise concerns:** All clips uploaded *must* be humanly replicable. If any sort of noise or background music is included, it must be removed as best as possible.
  Recommended tools for this are:
  * If you have FL Studio, its built in stem extractor is very powerful, and allows to extract vocals only from a sound.
  * An alternative is [Ultimate Vocal Remover](https://ultimatevocalremover.com/), using the *Kim Vocal 1* or *Kim Vocal 2* presets.
* **Extra files you can add for clips:** If files of these extensions with the same name as the audio clip are found, they will be used ingame.
  * **`.txt`:** will show up as a caption (if not added, the clip will have no caption)
  * **`.png`:** will show up as a thumbnail for the audio, preferably in square format (if not added, the clip will use `_pack_filler_image.png`)
* **Other types of packs:** If you want to submit mods that aren't voice pack related, you can add a link to them hosted in a different website into this readme file below. Recommended to list what it is and who made it (for example, "**[Sonic Adventure Judges](https://files.catbox.moe/1wvbu8.png)** (judge pack by Terionic)"
