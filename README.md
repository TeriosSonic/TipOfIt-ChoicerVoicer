# TO THE TIP OF IT (Choicer Voicer Pack)

## Guidelines
* **Categories:** If there are enough voice clips of a thing for it to warrant its own category, make it its own folder and have a thumbnail/name and other required files for it.
* **Uncategorized clips:** If a clip doesn't fit any existing categories it will go in the *Miscellaneous* folder.
* **Noise concerns:** All clips uploaded *must* be humanly replicable. If any sort of noise or background music is included, it must be removed as best as possible.
  Recommended tools for this are:
  * If you have FL Studio, its built in stem extractor is very powerful, and allows to extract vocals only from a sound.
  * An alternative is [Ultimate Vocal Remover](https://ultimatevocalremover.com/), using the *Kim Vocal 1* or *Kim Vocal 2* presets.
* **Other types of packs:** If you want to submit mods that aren't voice pack related, you can add a link to them hosted in a different website into this readme file below. Recommended to list what it is and who made it (for example, "**[Sonic Adventure Judges](https://files.catbox.moe/1wvbu8.png)** (judge pack by Terionic)"

## Other packs:
